# This file sets defaults for all /etc/conf.d/squash_* data.
# Depending on the openrc version, this is usually evaluated after above files.
# So make sure to not override variables already set in the above files.
# This file might also be used to patch functions from /etc/init.d/squash_dir
# (use this only if you know what you are doing!).

# Define the ORDER default:
: ${ORDER=overlayfs aufs unionfs-fuse funionfs unionfs}

# Do not store extended attributes unless overridden in /etc/conf.d/squash_*:
: ${MKSQUASHFS=-no-xattrs}
