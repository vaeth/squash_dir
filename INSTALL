There are essentially three possibilities to install the package:

1. Installation by portage (recommended)
========================================

If you are a Gentoo user (which you probably are if your are using openrc
which is required for this project)
you can just copy the tarball to your $DISTDIR
(by default /usr/portage/distfiles, but probably you will want to change
this anyway if you will use this package)
and then use the sys-fs/squash_dir ebuild of the mv overlay to install
the package. The mv overlay can be found at
	http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=user/mv.git;a=tree
and can be installed with layman ("layman -f" followed by "layman -a mv").

It is recommended to install also sys-fs/squashfs-tools from the same overlay
with USE=progress-redirect:
This will apply a patch to redirect the progress bar of mksquashfs to stderr
which will let squash_dir display that progress bar.

2. Manual installation
======================

Call as root
	cp -p init.d/squash_dir /etc/init.d
	cp -p conf.d/squash_dir /etc/conf.d
	cp -p sbin/squash_dir /usr/sbin
	cp -p zsh/_squash_dir /usr/share/zsh/site-functions

Here you can find the patches which redirect the progress bar of
mksquashfs to stderr:

http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=user/mv.git;a=tree;f=sys-fs/squashfs-tools/files

You can download the corresponding version and apply the patch manually with:
	cd "directory of squashfs-tools sources"
	patch -p0 <path-to-the-patch

3. Manual installation using autotools
======================================

Call

./mk/make (or, more or less equivalently, ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make)

and then as root

make install

The behaviour of "./configure" and "make" is the standard one of
projects using autotools as the build system.
The following special options are supported for ./configure:

--with-first-order=STR
  With STR being one of overlayfs, aufs, unionfs-fuse, funionfs, unionfs
  Patches the sources such that the corresponding STR becomes the first choice
  in the default ORDER.

--with-order=STR
  Patches the sources such that STR becomes the default ORDER.
