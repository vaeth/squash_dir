There are essentially three possibilities to install the package:

1. Installation by portage (recommended)
========================================

If you are a Gentoo user (which you probably are if your are using openrc
or the old gentoo initscripts - some of these are required for this project)
you can just copy the tarball to your $DISTDIR
(by default /usr/portage/distfiles, but probably you will want to change
this anyway if you will use this package)
and then use the sys-fs/squash_dir ebuild of the mv overlay to install
the package. The mv overlay can be found at
	http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=user/mv.git;a=tree
and can be installed with layman ("layman -f" followed by "layman -a mv").

2. Manual installation
======================

Call as root
	cp -p init.d/squash_dir /etc/init.d/squash_dir
	cp -p squash-dir /usr/sbin
(and apply the patches from squashfs-tools-patch to squashfs-tools if you
want them).

3. Manual installation using autotools
======================================

Call

mk/make (or, more or less equivalently, ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make)

and then as root

make install

The behaviour of "./configure" and "make" is the standard one of
projects using autotools as the build system.
There are only three special options:
	--enable-squashfs-tools-patch
	--disable-squashfs-tools-patch
(with mk/make, these are the options -p/-P)
which determine whether a patch for squashfs-tools will be activated
by creating and installing the file /etc/portage/env/sys-fs/squashfs-tools.
The third special option is only important if you enable these patches and
intend to compress them manually after installation. In that case you should
also use
	--with-decompress="command for corresponding decompressor"
(with mk/make, this is the option -d). The decompression command must expect
one further argument (the path of the compressed file) and send it decompressed
to stdout. A typical example is "xz -dc --".
