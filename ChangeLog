	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:

*squash_dir-12.10
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Let --with{,-first}-order patch conf.d/squash_dir correctly
	- Yet another change of default ORDER: overlayfs is first, as it
	  finally seems to be included into linux-3.11
	- Improve contrib files

*squash_dir-12.9
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Fix zsh completion: Treat context properly

*squash_dir-12.8
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:

	- Add RESTART option

*squash_dir-12.7
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Support global /etc/conf.d/squash_dir and provide default
	- Clear DIR_CHANGE even if THRESHOLD is not reached but no
	  essential change was made.

	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Add START command. Also add RESTART and STATUS to squash_dir.

*squash_dir-12.5
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:

	  lacking support starting with kernel 3.7.

	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Remove support for obsolete <sys-fs/unionfs-fuse-0.25

*squash_dir-12.3
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:

	- Fix COMPRESSION handling. Thanks to Massimo B. for reporting.
	- Cosmetical changes in formatting, autotools handling, zsh completion

*squash_dir-12.2
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Improve zsh completion, relying on >=runtitle-2.3

*squash_dir-12.1
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Change default of ORDER to honour changed likelihood of availability:
	  No recent aufs for kernel-3.6, but overlayfs works and might even be
	  included into the mainline kernel; unionfs seems to be dead.
	  For overlayfs, you must use the top patches in "heads":
	  http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/mszeredi/vfs.git;a=summary

*squash_dir-12.0
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- squash_dir wrapper now uses effective values of IGNORE_THRESHOLD,
	  MAGIC_FILE, KILL_FILE, instead of the defaults.
	- New commands: print_ignore_threshold, print_magic_file,
	  print_kill_file
	- Make all commands callable also for running init-script,
	  although this may be dangerous.
	- Make STOP callable also for running init-script.
	- Honour COMPRESSION and MKSQUASHFS also for the first initialization;
	  thanks to Gordex to reporting.

*squash_dir-11.16
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Fix regression in wrapper script (start of running is not an error)

*squash_dir-11.15
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Fix regression in wrapper script (two lines removed by mistake)

*squash_dir-11.14
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- "Succeed" (with error message) when using the read-only fallback
	- Introduce STOP action/parameter to execute the stop action even
	  if starting failed. Use with extreme care!
	- Fix help to describe options -T, -a, -A, and remove obsoleted -H

*squash_dir-11.9
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- More compatible usage of mkdir

*squash_dir-11.8
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Default to lazy umount, but print a warning if it is needed
	- Default locking to "auto" (depending whether /etc/mtab is a symlink)
	- Default/force noatime where possible
	- Remove MOUNT_AUFS_OPTS as it is better covered with MOUNT_AUFS
	- Cosmetical changes

*squash_dir-11.3
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Fix treatment of sh -c: -c does not take an argument

*squash_dir-11.2
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Improve error output in some cases

*squash_dir-11.1
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:

*squash_dir-10.17
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Improve zsh-completion

*squash_dir-10.16
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Provide zsh-completion

*squash_dir-10.15
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- No longer default to -i for MOUNT_AUFS (aufs2-util appears now safe).

*squash_dir-10.14
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Introduce KILL_FILE.
	- Introduce option -k to the squash_dir wrapper script
	- Introduce MOUNT_AUFS_OPTS.

*squash_dir-10.12
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Improve output of helper script again

*squash_dir-10.11
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Rename squash-dir -> squash_dir and improve its output slightly
	- Minor compatibility fixes

*squash_dir-10.10
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Make cd -P tacit to avoid strange errors and side effects

*squash_dir-10.9
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Provide fallback to cd -P if readlink does not exist

*squash_dir-10.8
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Use -o hide_meta_files instead of -o hide_meta_dir with unionfs-fuse:
	  http://podgorny.cz/~bernd/hg/hgwebdir.cgi/0.25/rev/081dfa9621fe

*squash_dir-10.7
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Normalize DIR_SQUASH and DIR_CHANGE to get correct information
	  with mountinfo (fixes regression introduced in squash_dir-10.6).
	- Fix typo in automagic setting of UNIONFS_FUSE_HIDE.

*squash_dir-10.6
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Use mountinfo if available to umount only if directory is really
	  mounted. So "squash_dir stop" may succeed at a second call if the
	  first call umounted only the union but could not umount the squashfs
	  e.g. because the directory was busy.
	- In case of failing umount of squashfs sleep and retry. This may fix
	  problems if umount of unionfs returns while squashfs is still busy.

*squash_dir-10.5
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Introduce UNIONFS_USE_HIDE="-o hide_meta_dir" if unionfs-fuse
	  supports it.

*squash_dir-10.4
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Fix dependency bug of automake:
	  sysconf_DATA was not considered as data but as exe.

*squash_dir-10.3
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Avoid race conditions in trap in squash-dir
	- Remove usage of "local" keyword, thus being now practically POSIX
	  except for find -path, mktemp, and possibly flock.
	- Remove sys-fs/squashfs-tools patches (and the hacks to apply them)
	  since they do not really belong into this project.
	  You can find them (and ebuilds to apply them) in the mv overlay:
	  http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=user/mv.git;a=tree
	- Note that if you had earlier installed ebuild hacks, you have a file
	  /etc/portage/env/sys-fs/squashfs-tools
	  You should better remove this file and use instead the
	  above mentioned ebuilds from the mv overlay.

*squash_dir-10.2
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Hardcode PORTAGE_COMPRESS into squashfs-tools patching function.
	  Otherwise problems would arise if PORTAGE_COMPRESS is changed
	  after installation
	- Improve informal/error messages in squashfs-tools patching function.
	- Place squash-dir into /usr/sbin
	- Minor fixes in auxiliary scripts and docs

*squash_dir-10.1
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Consistent usage of UTF8

*squash_dir-10.0
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- IMPORTANT CHANGE: When called for the first time (with a new config)
	  squash_dir will now create $FILE_SQFS automatically and, moreover,
	  will then *clean* (i.e. *remove*, *unlink*, *destroy*) $DIRECTORY.
	  Of course, several sanity checks are made before doing so, and
	  usually, you can revert this by using unsquashfs $FILE_SQFS
	  (unless you used a vital directory) but some information such as
	  hard links might have got lost permanently in this process, so:
	  TAKE CARE!!
	- First version with autotools
	- Treat IGNORE* variables differently (and introduce some new),
	  basing the test on the find utility. It is required that the
	  find utility knows the -path option which is not (yet) POSIX.
	  Note that the KEEP variable has not changed since that works
	  by a different mechanism
	- Minor modifications in mounting unionfs-fuse and funionfs
	  (customizable default options, no test after mounting)

*squash_dir-9.0
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Support for unionfs-fuse and put it on second place in ORDER.
	- print_dir_change and print_dir_squash now append a "/"

*squash_dir-1.0
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Initial implementation based on synss' script, see
	  http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-465367-highlight-.html
