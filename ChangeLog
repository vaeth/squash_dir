# ChangeLog for squash_dir

*squash_dir-10.2
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Hardcode PORTAGE_COMPRESS into squashfs-tools patching function.
	  Otherwise problems would arise if PORTAGE_COMPRESS is changed
	  after installation
	- Improve informal/error messages in squashfs-tools patching function.
	- Place squash-dir into /usr/sbin
	- Minor fixes in auxiliary scripts and docs

*squash_dir-10.1
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Consistent usage of UTF8

*squash_dir-10.0
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- IMPORTANT CHANGE: When called for the first time (with a new config)
	  squash_dir will now create $FILE_SQFS automatically and, moreover,
	  will then *clean* (i.e. *remove*, *unlink*, *destroy*) $DIRECTORY.
	  Of course, several sanity checks are made before doing so, and
	  usually, you can revert this by using unsquashfs $FILE_SQFS
	  (unless you used a vital directory) but some information such as
	  hard links might have got lost permanently in this process, so:
	  TAKE CARE!!
	- First version with autotools
	- Treat IGNORE* variables differently (and introduce some new),
	  basing the test on the find utility. It is required that the
	  find utility knows the -path option which is not (yet) POSIX.
	  Note that the KEEP variable has not changed since that works
	  by a different mechanism
	- Minor modifications in mounting unionfs-fuse and funionfs
	  (customizable default options, no test after mounting)

*squash_dir-9.0
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Support for unionfs-fuse and put it on second place in ORDER.
	- print_dir_change and print_dir_squash now append a "/"

*squash_dir-1.0
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Initial implementation based on synss' script, see
	  http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-465367-highlight-.html
